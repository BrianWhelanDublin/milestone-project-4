## Unit Testing

- ### Django Unit Testing   

    - Each app was tested using Django unit testing.
    - Tests where written to test the Urls, Models, Forms, and the Views.
    - To run the tests in the terminal you can type the following command
    -
        ```
            python3 manage.py test
        ```
    - To show how much of the app has been covered by the testing I used coverage.
    - Coverage generates a report to show how much of the code that has been tested and how much is yet to be tested.
    - You can then run coverage html to show the report on the screen.
    - To open the report you can run 
        - 
        ```
            python3 -m http.server
        ```
    - I've included the reports for each app below.


## Test and Bugs During Development


- Post Data
    - During Development I had an issue sending the post data while using stripe as I had decided to use vanilla javascript instead of jQuery.
    - When I was sending the data the CSRF token wasn't working.
    - I researched and found a solution on stack overflow.
    - I also had to use the FormData() constructor to hold the data before posting it.
    - Once this was done the code then sent the data to the cache_checkout_data view.
    - 
        ``` javascript
                let csrfToken = document.querySelector('[name="csrfmiddlewaretoken"]').value
                let postData = new FormData()
                postData.set("csrfmiddlewaretoken", csrfToken)
                postData.set("client_secret", clientSecret)
                postData.set("save_info", saveInfo)
                let url = "/checkout/cache_checkout_data/";
            // stack overflow  code to help with the fetch and CSRF tokens
                fetch(url, {
                    method: "POST",
                    headers: {
                        "X-CSRFToken": csrfToken,
                    },
                    body: postData
                }).then(() => {
                    // rest of code 
        ```
