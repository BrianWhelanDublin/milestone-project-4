## Unit Testing

- ### Django Unit Testing   

    - Each app was tested using Django unit testing.
    - Tests were written to test the URLs, Models, Forms, and the Views.
    - To run the tests in the terminal you can type the following command
    -
        ```
            python3 manage.py test
        ```
    - To show how much of the app has been covered by the testing I used coverage.
    - Coverage generates a report to show how much of the code has been tested and how much is yet to be tested.
    - You can then run coverage HTML to show the report on the screen.
    - To open the report you can run 
        - ```
            python3 -m http.server
          ```

    - I've included the reports for each app below.

## Test and Bugs During Development

- #### Posting Data in the Cart App.
    - During Development I had an issue sending the post data while using stripe as I had decided to use vanilla javascript instead of jQuery.
    - When I was sending the data the CSRF token wasn't working.
    - I researched the issue and on stack overflow found the following solution which fixed the issue by placing 
    - By using the Headers key with X-CSRFTToken 
    -
        ``` javascript
            fetch(url, {
                method: "POST",
                headers: {
                    "X-CSRFToken": csrfToken
                },
        ```

- #### Moving Fetch function into its own file.
    - I had an issue when I moved my javascript into its own file when it was using the fetch function with the csrfToken.
    - I then found that declaring the csrfToken variable in a script tag on the HTML page before importing the javascript file fixed the issue
    - 
        ``` html
            <script>
                let csrfToken = "{{ csrf_token }}";
            </script>
            <script src="{% static 'cart/js/cart.js' %}"></script>
        ```


- #### Post Data in the Strip js
    - During developing the javascript for skype I had an issue with posting the data.
    - When I declared my data into a dictionary and tried to post it, it would work properly.
    - Through researching the issue I found that using the FormData constructor fixed the issue.
    - Once this was done the code then sent the data to the cache_checkout_data view.
    - 
        ``` javascript
                let csrfToken = document.querySelector('[name="csrfmiddlewaretoken"]').value
                let postData = new FormData()
                postData.set("csrfmiddlewaretoken", csrfToken)
                postData.set("client_secret", clientSecret)
                postData.set("save_info", saveInfo)
                let url = "/checkout/cache_checkout_data/";
            // stack overflow  code to help with the fetch and CSRF tokens
                fetch(url, {
                    method: "POST",
                    headers: {
                        "X-CSRFToken": csrfToken,
                    },
                    body: postData
                }).then(() => {
                    // rest of code 
        ```
    
- #### Blue background in forms on google chrome.
    - When I was testing my forms I noticed on google chrome they had a blue background colour that didn't sit well with the website design.
    - To fix this issue I researched and found it was styling that google chrome was applying to the forms.
    - I found code on StackOverflow to fix this.
    - By placing the following into my base CSS.
    - 
        ``` css
            /* code from stack overflow to stop my inputs 
            turning a light blue when filled in */
            input:-webkit-autofill,
            input:-webkit-autofill:hover,
            input:-webkit-autofill:focus textarea:-webkit-autofill,
            textarea:-webkit-autofill:hover textarea:-webkit-autofill:focus,
            select:-webkit-autofill,
            select:-webkit-autofill:hover,
            select:-webkit-autofill:focus {
                -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 0px 1000px #EDEDE9 inset !important;
                box-shadow: 0 0 0px 1000px #EDEDE9 inset !important;
            }
                input:-webkit-autofill {
                    -webkit-text-fill-color: #153243 !important;
                }
        ```

- #### Error With Decimal Fields.
    - During the Development I noticed an issue with some of my items during the checkout.
    - I researched the issue and then figured out I had set my decimal fields too low in the models and as It was a furniture store and prices were higher they were causing an error.
    - I used the following page from stack overflow to fix this issue.
        - [Django Error class decimal](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56458774/django-error-class-decimal-invalidoperation)


## Defensive Programming and Security

- Security
    - Environmental variables
        - For security reasons I have followed standard practices and used os to declare the environmental variables for any sensitive information.
        - For Development, these variables are declared in the settings section of gitpod.
        - In doing this it means that sensitive information such as passwords and secret keys aren't put in a public place.
        - To deploy on Heroku these environmental variables are also placed into the settings, config variables section.

    - Users passwords.
        - I have used Django all auth to handle the user's login and signup.
        - This stores the users pass as a hashed key for security.
        - It also makes the users confirm their emails as an extra security step.
    
    - ### Defensive Programming.
        
        - I have used code in my project to make sure actions cannot occur by placing URLs into the browser. 

        - If for instance the user types in the URL to delete a post the application has been programmed to redirect the user elsewhere and show an error message. 

        - I have tested this by typing the URLs into the browser it has worked as expected

        - I have also placed a confirmation modal to check if a user is sure they want to delete anything on the site such as, deleting the entire wishlist, or deleting a stock item for the superusers.
        
        - This will minimize the user deleting things by mistake.

## Manual Testing
